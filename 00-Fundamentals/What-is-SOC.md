# What is a SOC (Security Operations Center)?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized function responsible for continuously **monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding** to cybersecurity threats within an organization.

The SOC acts as the **defensive nerve center**, ensuring threats are identified early and handled effectively.

## 🎯 Primary Objectives of a SOC
- Detect security threats in real time
- Investigate suspicious activity
- Respond to incidents quickly and accurately
- Minimize business impact
- Improve security posture over time

---

## 👥 SOC Team Roles (High Level)

### SOC Analyst Tier 1
- Monitor alerts
- Perform initial triage
- Identify false positives
- Escalate confirmed incidents

### SOC Analyst Tier 2
- Deep investigation
- Log correlation
- Threat analysis
- Containment recommendations

### SOC Analyst Tier 3 / Threat Hunter
- Proactive threat hunting
- Detection engineering
- Advanced investigations
- Adversary behavior analysis

## 🚨 Alert vs Incident

| Alert | Incident |
|------|----------|
| Tool-generated signal | Confirmed malicious activity |
| May be false positive | Requires response |
| First stage | Escalation stage |

## 🔁 SOC Operational Workflow
1. **Monitoring**
2. **Alerting**
3. **Triage**
4. **Investigation**
5. **Response**
6. **Recovery**
7. **Lessons Learned**

This workflow aligns with industry-standard incident response practices and frameworks such as **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.

## 🧠 Why SOC Matters
Without a SOC:
- Attacks go unnoticed
- Dwell time increases
- Damage becomes severe

With a SOC:
- Faster detection
- Reduced attacker dwell time
- Stronger security maturity

## 🔗 Practice Mapping
This foundational concept is applied throughout:
- All SOC case studies
- Incident investigations
- Threat hunting activities
