# Alert Fatigue

**Alert Fatigue** occurs when SOC analysts are overwhelmed by a large number of alerts, many of which are false positives.

---

## ⚠️ Why Alert Fatigue Happens
- Poorly tuned detections
- Too many low-quality alerts
- Lack of context
- Limited SOC staffing

---

## 🚨 Risks
- Missed real attacks
- Slower response times
- Analyst burnout
- Reduced detection quality

---

## 🧠 SOC Mitigation Strategies
- Alert prioritization
- Detection tuning
- Automation & enrichment
- Use of MITRE ATT&CK mapping

---

## 📊 SOC Perspective
Quality > Quantity

A few high-confidence alerts are better than hundreds of noisy ones.

---

## 🔗 Practice Mapping
Seen in:
- SIEM tuning
- Detection engineering
- SOC operational metrics
