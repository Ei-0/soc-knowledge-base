# Assume Breach Mindset

The **Assume Breach** mindset is a core philosophy in modern SOC operations.

Instead of assuming systems are secure, SOC teams **assume attackers may already be inside** and focus on detection, visibility, and response.

---

## 🧠 What Does Assume Breach Mean?
It means:
- Prevention can and will fail
- Attackers bypass controls
- Detection is critical
- Visibility is mandatory

SOC analysts operate under the assumption that **compromise is possible at any time**.

---

## ❌ Why Prevention Alone Is Not Enough
- Zero-day vulnerabilities
- Phishing bypasses email security
- Credential theft bypasses MFA
- Misconfigurations expose systems

No organization has perfect prevention.

---

## 🚨 SOC Analyst Responsibilities Under Assume Breach
- Continuously monitor logs
- Investigate suspicious behavior
- Correlate weak signals
- Detect lateral movement and persistence

---

## 🛡️ Detection Over Perfection
The goal is not to stop **every** attack, but to:
- Detect attacks early
- Limit attacker dwell time
- Reduce impact

This mindset aligns closely with behavior-based frameworks like **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.

## 🔗 Practice Mapping
Assume Breach is applied in:
- Threat hunting
- Detection engineering
- Incident response
- SOC case investigations
