# SOC Metrics (MTTD & MTTR)

SOC metrics measure how effectively a SOC detects and responds to incidents.

---

## ⏱️ Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
Time taken to detect a security incident.

Why It Matters:
- Shorter MTTD = less attacker dwell time
- Faster containment

---

## ⏱️ Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
Time taken to respond and contain an incident.

Why It Matters:
- Faster recovery
- Reduced business impact

---

## 📊 Other Common SOC Metrics
- Alert volume
- False positive rate
- Incident closure rate
- Escalation rate

---

## 🧠 SOC Analyst Impact
SOC analysts directly influence:
- Detection speed
- Response efficiency
- Incident quality

---

## 🔗 Practice Mapping
Metrics are used in:
- SOC performance reviews
- Incident reporting
- Management dashboards
