# Protocols in Logs (SOC Analyst Perspective)

Protocols rarely appear as raw packets in SOC investigations.  
Instead, analysts rely on logs generated by security and infrastructure tools.

Understanding how protocols appear in logs is essential for accurate triage and investigation.

---

## Why Logs Matter in SOC
Logs provide:
- Historical visibility
- Context around alerts
- Correlation across systems
- Evidence for incident response

---

## Where Protocols Appear

### Firewall Logs
Show:
- Source and destination IPs
- Ports and protocol
- Allowed or blocked actions
- Session counts

Common use cases:
- Detect scanning
- Identify suspicious outbound connections
- Validate policy enforcement

---

### IDS / IPS Logs
Show:
- Protocol-specific signatures
- Exploit attempts
- Anomalous behavior

Common use cases:
- Detect protocol abuse
- Identify exploit payloads
- Alert on known attack patterns

---

### Proxy / Web Logs
Show:
- HTTP/HTTPS activity
- URLs and domains
- User-agent strings
- Response codes

Common use cases:
- Malware C2 detection
- Data exfiltration
- Policy violations

---

### DNS Logs
Show:
- Queried domains
- Record types
- Response codes
- Query frequency

Common use cases:
- DNS tunneling detection
- Beaconing analysis
- Domain reputation checks

---

### Endpoint / EDR Logs
Show:
- Process-to-network relationships
- Protocol usage by applications
- Suspicious outbound connections

Common use cases:
- Identify malware processes
- Confirm user vs system activity

---

## SOC Investigation Workflow
1. Identify protocol from alert or log
2. Determine expected vs unexpected behavior
3. Pivot across multiple log sources
4. Correlate with endpoint activity
5. Decide on containment or escalation

---

## Key Takeaway
Logs translate raw protocol behavior into **actionable SOC evidence**.
